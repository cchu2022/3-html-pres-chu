                    <p>Hunger is causing millions of people, locally and worldwide, to have malnutrition. Malnutrition occurs when a person’s diet doesn’t contain the right amount of nutrients they need, causing their body to not function properly. This results in the person being undernourished, leading to the person being more prone to diseases, weak immune systems, physical and mental stunting, and it limits their abilities in life.</p>

                <p>A healthy population is a key piece in building a better future. Having healthy and strong people would lead to more educated people, a better worldwide economy, a decrease in worldwide health issues, as well as a decline in the spread of diseases. Because of world hunger, it is holding back not only the ability of individuals but also the ability of us working together in building a better future. More healthy people in the world means more people able to contribute to the growth and development of our world, which will benefit all of us.</p>

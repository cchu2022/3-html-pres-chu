                    <h2>What is the Problem?</h2>
                    <p>The world produces enough food to feed all 7 billion people, so why are there still people in the world suffering from hunger? The answer is that some people are simply too poor buy food or they lack the resources to grow food. The main cause of world hunger is poverty. People who can't afford to buy nutritious food The causes of poverty are mainly conflicts, such as war, terrorism, civil wars within countries, and other violence. Because of the economic imbalance and the unequal distribution of food, many people are undernourished, causing them to suffer chronic hunger. Chronic hunger is when people don't have the option of eating when they are hunger. This means they do not get enough calories and nutrients, resulting in them having little energy.</p>

                    <p style="padding-left: 15%;">Hunger is causing millions of people, locally and worldwide, to have malnutrition. Malnutrition occurs when a person’s diet doesn’t contain the right amount of nutrients they need, causing their body to not function properly. This results in the person being undernourished, leading to the person being more prone to diseases, weak immune systems, physical and mental stunting, and it limits their abilities in life. Hunger traps them in an unhealthy lifestyle where it is difficult to escape. Because they are undernourished, they have less energy and strength, resulting in them being less productive. Millions of kids go to school hungry, and hunger can impact their ability to strive in school, causing them to receive a poorer education. Hunger can also impact people’s everyday work, as well as diminish their efforts of trying to free themselves from the hunger trap. </p>

                    <p>Hunger is causing millions of people, locally and worldwide, to have malnutrition. Malnutrition occurs when a person’s diet doesn’t contain the right amount of nutrients they need, causing their body to not function properly. This results in the person being undernourished, leading to the person being more prone to diseases, weak immune systems, physical and mental stunting, and it limits their abilities in life.</p>
